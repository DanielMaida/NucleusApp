<h2>The Nucleus Project</h2>

The nucleus project objective is to prevent the incorrect waste disposal in the envinronment. Our app keeps the track of the oil level in the registered smart ecopoints. If you want to dispose your waste we also provide the best route for you to do so.

We want to preserve the planet for the future generations, if you want to contribute for the Nucleus Project and the ecosystem or to register your own smart ecopoint, please feel free to contact us!
